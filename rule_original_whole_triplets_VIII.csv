Unless otherwise provided in the basic act, the use of lump sums, unit costs or flat-rate financing shall be authorised by a decision of the authorising officer responsible, who shall act in accordance with the internal rules of the Union institution concerned. The authorisation decision shall contain at least the following: (a) justification concerning the appropriateness of such forms of financing with regard to the nature of the supported actions or work programmes, as well as to the risks of irregularities and fraud and costs of control; (b) identification of the costs or categories of costs covered by lump sums, unit costs or flat-rate financing, which shall be considered eligible in accordance with points (c), (e) and (f) of Article 186(3) and Article 186(4), and which shall exclude ineligible costs under the applicable Union rules; (c) description of the methods for determining lump sums, unit costs or flat-rate financing. Those methods shall be based on one of the following: (i) statistical data, similar objective means or an expert judgement provided by internally available experts or procured in accordance with the applicable rules; or (ii) beneficiary-by-beneficiary approach, by reference to certified or auditable historical data of the beneficiary or to its usual cost accounting practices; (d) where possible, the essential conditions triggering the payment, including, where applicable, the achievement of outputs and/or results; (e) where lump sums, unit costs and flat rates are not output based and/or result based, a justification on why an output based and/or result based approach is not possible or appropriate.

The authorising officer responsible may authorise or impose, in the form of flat-rates, funding of the beneficiary’s indirect costs up to a maximum of 7 % of total eligible direct costs for the action. A higher flat rate may be authorised by a reasoned Commission decision. The authorising officer responsible shall report in the annual activity report referred to in Article 74(9) on any such decision taken, the flat rate authorised and the reasons leading to that decision.
