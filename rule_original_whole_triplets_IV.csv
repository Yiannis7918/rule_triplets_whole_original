The Commission and Member States shall respect the principles of sound financial management, transparency and non-discrimination and shall ensure the visibility of the Union action when they manage Union funds. To that end, the Commission and Member States shall fulfil their respective control and audit obligations and assume the resulting responsibilities laid down in this Regulation. Complementary provisions shall be laid down in sector-specific rules. When executing tasks relating to budget implementation, Member States shall take all the necessary measures, including legislative, regulatory and administrative measures, to protect the financial interests of the Union, namely by: (a) ensuring that actions financed from the budget are implemented correctly and effectively and in accordance with the applicable sector-specific rules; (b) designating bodies responsible for the management and control of Union funds in accordance with paragraph 3, and supervising such bodies; L 193/58  (c) preventing, detecting and correcting irregularities and fraud; (d) cooperating, in accordance with this Regulation and sector-specific rules, with the Commission, OLAF, the Court of Auditors and, for those Member States participating in enhanced cooperation pursuant to Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 ( 1 ), with the European Public Prosecutorâ€™s Office (EPPO). In order to protect the financial interests of the Union, Member States shall, while respecting the principle of proporÂ­tionality, and in compliance with this Article and the relevant sector-specific rules, carry out ex ante and ex post controls including, where appropriate, on-the-spot checks on representative and/or risk-based samples of transactions. They shall also recover funds unduly paid and bring legal proceedings where necessary in that regard. Member States shall impose effective, dissuasive and proportionate penalties on recipients where provided for in sector- specific rules or in specific provisions in national law. As part of its risk assessment and in accordance with sector-specific rules, the Commission shall monitor the management and control systems established in Member States. The Commission shall, in its audit work, respect the principle of proportionality and shall take into account the level of risk assessed in accordance with sector-specific rules. In accordance with the criteria and procedures laid down in sector-specific rules, Member States shall, at the appropriate level, designate bodies to be responsible for the management and control of Union funds. Such bodies may also carry out tasks not related to the management of Union funds and may entrust certain of their tasks to other bodies. When deciding on the designation of bodies, Member States may base their decision on whether the management and control systems are essentially the same as those already in place for the previous period and whether they have functioned effectively. If audit and control results show that the designated bodies no longer comply with the criteria set out in sector-specific rules, Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that deficiencies in the implementation of the tasks of those bodies are remedied, including by ending the designation in accordance with sector-specific rules. Sector-specific rules shall define the role of the Commission in the process set out in this paragraph. Bodies designated pursuant to paragraph 3 shall: (a) set up and ensure the functioning of an effective and efficient internal control system; (b) use an accounting system that provides accurate, complete and reliable information in a timely manner; (c) provide the information required under paragraphs 5, 6 and 7; (d) ensure ex post publication in accordance with Article 38(2) to (6). Any processing of personal data shall comply with Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Bodies designated pursuant to paragraph 3 shall, by 15 February of the following financial year, provide the Commission with: (a) their accounts on the expenditure that was incurred, during the relevant reference period as defined in sector-specific rules, in the execution of their tasks and that was presented to the Commission for reimbursement; (b) an annual summary of the final audit reports and of controls carried out, including an analysis of the nature and extent of errors and weaknesses identified in systems, as well as corrective action taken or planned. The accounts referred to in point (a) of paragraph 5 shall include pre-financing and sums for which recovery procedures are ongoing or have been completed. They shall be accompanied by a management declaration confirming that, in the opinion of those in charge of the management of the funds: (a) the information is properly presented, complete and accurate; (b) the expenditure was used for its intended purpose, as defined in sector-specific rules; (c) the control systems put in place ensure the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.  L 193/59 1). The accounts referred to in point (a) of paragraph 5 and the summary referred to in point (b) of that paragraph shall be accompanied by an opinion of an independent audit body, drawn up in accordance with internationally accepted audit standards. That opinion shall establish whether the accounts give a true and fair view, whether expenditure for which reimbursement has been requested from the Commission is legal and regular, and whether the control systems put in place function properly. The opinion shall also state whether the audit work puts in doubt the assertions made in the management declaration referred to in paragraph 6. The deadline of 15 February set out in paragraph 5 may exceptionally be extended by the Commission to 1 March, upon communication by the Member State concerned. Member States may, at the appropriate level, publish the information referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 and in this paragraph.
