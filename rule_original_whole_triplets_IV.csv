The Commission and Member States shall respect the principles of sound financial management, transparency and non-discrimination and shall ensure the visibility of the Union action when they manage Union funds. To that end, the Commission and Member States shall fulfil their respective control and audit obligations and assume the resulting responsibilities laid down in this Regulation. Complementary provisions shall be laid down in sector-specific rules. When executing tasks relating to budget implementation, Member States shall take all the necessary measures, including legislative, regulatory and administrative measures, to protect the financial interests of the Union, namely by: (a) ensuring that actions financed from the budget are implemented correctly and effectively and in accordance with the applicable sector-specific rules; (b) designating bodies responsible for the management and control of Union funds in accordance with paragraph 3, and supervising such bodies; L 193/58  (c) preventing, detecting and correcting irregularities and fraud; (d) cooperating, in accordance with this Regulation and sector-specific rules, with the Commission, OLAF, the Court of Auditors and, for those Member States participating in enhanced cooperation pursuant to Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 ( 1 ), with the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO). In order to protect the financial interests of the Union, Member States shall, while respecting the principle of propor­tionality, and in compliance with this Article and the relevant sector-specific rules, carry out ex ante and ex post controls including, where appropriate, on-the-spot checks on representative and/or risk-based samples of transactions. They shall also recover funds unduly paid and bring legal proceedings where necessary in that regard. Member States shall impose effective, dissuasive and proportionate penalties on recipients where provided for in sector- specific rules or in specific provisions in national law. As part of its risk assessment and in accordance with sector-specific rules, the Commission shall monitor the management and control systems established in Member States. The Commission shall, in its audit work, respect the principle of proportionality and shall take into account the level of risk assessed in accordance with sector-specific rules. In accordance with the criteria and procedures laid down in sector-specific rules, Member States shall, at the appropriate level, designate bodies to be responsible for the management and control of Union funds. Such bodies may also carry out tasks not related to the management of Union funds and may entrust certain of their tasks to other bodies. When deciding on the designation of bodies, Member States may base their decision on whether the management and control systems are essentially the same as those already in place for the previous period and whether they have functioned effectively. If audit and control results show that the designated bodies no longer comply with the criteria set out in sector-specific rules, Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that deficiencies in the implementation of the tasks of those bodies are remedied, including by ending the designation in accordance with sector-specific rules. Sector-specific rules shall define the role of the Commission in the process set out in this paragraph. Bodies designated pursuant to paragraph 3 shall: (a) set up and ensure the functioning of an effective and efficient internal control system; (b) use an accounting system that provides accurate, complete and reliable information in a timely manner; (c) provide the information required under paragraphs 5, 6 and 7; (d) ensure ex post publication in accordance with Article 38(2) to (6). Any processing of personal data shall comply with Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Bodies designated pursuant to paragraph 3 shall, by 15 February of the following financial year, provide the Commission with: (a) their accounts on the expenditure that was incurred, during the relevant reference period as defined in sector-specific rules, in the execution of their tasks and that was presented to the Commission for reimbursement; (b) an annual summary of the final audit reports and of controls carried out, including an analysis of the nature and extent of errors and weaknesses identified in systems, as well as corrective action taken or planned. The accounts referred to in point (a) of paragraph 5 shall include pre-financing and sums for which recovery procedures are ongoing or have been completed. They shall be accompanied by a management declaration confirming that, in the opinion of those in charge of the management of the funds: (a) the information is properly presented, complete and accurate; (b) the expenditure was used for its intended purpose, as defined in sector-specific rules; (c) the control systems put in place ensure the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.  L 193/59 1). The accounts referred to in point (a) of paragraph 5 and the summary referred to in point (b) of that paragraph shall be accompanied by an opinion of an independent audit body, drawn up in accordance with internationally accepted audit standards. That opinion shall establish whether the accounts give a true and fair view, whether expenditure for which reimbursement has been requested from the Commission is legal and regular, and whether the control systems put in place function properly. The opinion shall also state whether the audit work puts in doubt the assertions made in the management declaration referred to in paragraph 6. The deadline of 15 February set out in paragraph 5 may exceptionally be extended by the Commission to 1 March, upon communication by the Member State concerned. Member States may, at the appropriate level, publish the information referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 and in this paragraph. In addition, Member States may provide to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Commission declarations signed at the appropriate level based on the information referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 and in this paragraph. In order to ensure that Union funds are used in accordance with the applicable rules, the Commission shall: (a) apply procedures for the examination and acceptance of the accounts of the designated bodies, ensuring that the accounts are complete, accurate and true; (b) exclude from Union financing expenditure for which disbursements have been made in breach of applicable law; (c) interrupt payment deadlines or suspend payments where provided for in sector-specific rules. The Commission shall end all or part of the interruption of payment deadlines or suspension of payments after a Member State has presented its observations and as soon as it has taken any necessary measures. The annual activity report referred to in Article 74(9) shall cover all the obligations under this paragraph.

The accounting officer shall exercise due diligence to ensure that the Union receives its revenue and shall ensure that the Union’s rights are safeguarded. Partial reimbursement by a debtor who is subject to several recovery orders shall first be posted on the oldest entitlement unless otherwise specified by the debtor. Any partial payments shall first cover the interest. The accounting officer shall recover amounts due to the budget by offsetting them in accordance with Article 102. The authorising officer responsible may waive recovery of all or part of an established amount receivable only in the following cases: (a) where the foreseeable cost of recovery would exceed the amount to be recovered and the waiver would not harm the image of the Union; (b) where the amount receivable cannot be recovered in view of its age, of delay in the dispatch of the debit note in the terms defined in Article 98(2), of the insolvency of the debtor, or of any other insolvency proceedings; (c) where recovery is inconsistent with the principle of proportionality. Where the authorising officer responsible plans to waive or partially waive recovery of an established amount receivable, he or she shall ensure that the waiver is in order and is in accordance with the principles of sound financial management and proportionality. The decision to waive recovery shall be substantiated. The authorising officer may delegate the power to take that decision. In the case referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 2, the authorising officer responsible shall act in accordance with predetermined procedures established within his or her Union institution and shall apply the following criteria which are compulsory and applicable in all circumstances: (a) the facts, having regard to the gravity of the irregularity giving rise to the establishment of the amount receivable (fraud, repeated offence, intent, diligence, good faith, manifest error);   (b) the impact that waiving recovery would have on the operation of the Union and its financial interests (amount involved, risk of setting a precedent, undermining of the authority of the law). Depending on the circumstances of the case, the authorising officer responsible shall, where appropriate, take the following additional criteria into account: (a) any distortion of competition that would be caused by the waiving of recovery; (b) the economic and social damage that would be caused were the debt to be recovered in full. Each Union institution shall send to the European Parliament and to the Council each year a report on the waivers granted by it pursuant to paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Article. Information on waivers below EUR 60 000 shall be provided as a total amount. In the case of the Commission, that report shall be annexed to the summary of the annual activity reports referred to in Article 74(9).

The partial cancellation of an established amount receivable does not imply the waiver of the remaining established Union entitlement. In the event of a mistake, the authorising officer responsible shall cancel totally or partially the established amount receivable and include adequate reasons. Each Union institution shall in its internal rules lay down the conditions and procedure for delegating the power to cancel an established amount receivable. Member States shall have primary responsibility for carrying out controls and audits and for recovering amounts unduly spent, as provided for in sector-specific rules. To the extent that Member States detect and correct irregularities on their own account, they shall be exempt from financial corrections by the Commission concerning those irregularities. The Commission shall make financial corrections on Member States in order to exclude expenditure incurred in breach of applicable law from Union financing. The Commission shall base its financial corrections on the identification of amounts unduly spent, and the financial implications for the budget. Where such amounts cannot be identified precisely, the Commission may apply extrapolated or flat-rate corrections in accordance with sector-specific rules. The Commission shall, when deciding on the amount of a financial correction, take account of the nature and gravity of the breach of applicable law and the financial implications for the budget, including deficiencies in management and control systems. The criteria for establishing financial corrections and the procedure to be followed may be laid down in sector-specific rules. The methodology for applying extrapolated or flat-rate corrections shall be laid down in accordance with sector- specific rules with a view to enabling the Commission to protect the financial interests of the Union."

The authorising officer responsible shall validate expenditure by accepting that an item of expenditure is charged to the budget, after having checked the supporting documents attesting the creditor’s entitlement as per the conditions set in the legal commitment when there is a legal commitment. For that purpose, the authorising officer responsible shall: (a) verify the existence of the creditor’s entitlement; (b) determine or verify the reality and the amount of the claim through the endorsement ‘certified correct’; (c) verify the conditions according to which payment is due. Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, the validation of expenditure shall also apply to interim or final reports not associated with a payment request in which case the impact on the accounting system is limited to the general accounts. The validation decision shall be expressed through electronically secured signature in accordance with Article 146 by the authorising officer, or by a technically competent member of staff duly empowered by a formal decision of the authorising officer, or, exceptionally, for paper workflow take the form of a stamp incorporating that signature. L 193/82  With the endorsement ‘certified correct’ the authorising officer responsible, or a technically competent member of staff duly empowered by the authorising officer responsible, shall certify: (a) for pre-financing: that the conditions required in the legal commitment for the payment of the pre-financing are met; (b) for interim and balance payments in contracts: that the services provided for in the contract have been properly provided, the supplies properly delivered or that the work has been properly carried out; (c) for interim and balance payments in grants: that the action or work programme carried out by the beneficiary is in all respects in compliance with the grant agreement, including, where applicable that the costs declared by the bene­ficiary are eligible. In the case referred to in point (c) of the second subparagraph, cost estimates shall not be deemed to comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Article 186(3). The same principle shall also apply to interim and final reports not associated to a payment request. In order to authorise the expenditure, the authorising officer responsible shall, after having verified that the appropriations are available, issue a payment order to instruct the accounting officer to pay the amount of expenditure which was previously validated. Where periodic payments are made with regard to services rendered, including rental services, or goods delivered, the authorising officer may, subject to that officer’s risk analysis, order the application of a direct debit system from an imprest account. The application of such a system may also be ordered if it is specifically authorised by the accounting officer in accordance with Article 86(3)."
