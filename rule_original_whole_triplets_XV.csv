The European Parliament and the Council shall deliberate upon the building project within two weeks of its receipt by both institutions. The building project shall be deemed to be approved at the expiry of this two-week period, unless the European Parliament and/or the Council take a decision contrary to the proposal within this period of time. The following shall be considered as building projects likely to have significant financial implications for the budget: (a) any acquisition of land; (b) the acquisition, sale, structural renovation, construction of buildings or any project combining those elements to be implemented in the same timeframe, exceeding EUR 3 000 000; (c) the acquisition, structural renovation, construction of buildings or any project combining those elements to be implemented in the same timeframe, exceeding EUR 2 000 000 in the event that the price represents more than 110 % of the local price of comparable properties as evaluated by an independent expert; (d) the sale of land or buildings in the event that the price represents less than 90 % of the local price of comparable properties as evaluated by an independent expert; (e) any new building contract, including usufructs, long-term leases and renewals of existing building contracts under less favourable conditions, not covered by point (b) with an annual charge of at least EUR 750 000; (f) the extension or renewal of existing building contracts, including usufruct and long-term leases, under the same or more favourable conditions, with an annual charge of at least EUR 3 000 000. This paragraph shall also apply to building projects which have an interinstitutional nature, as well as to Union delegations. The thresholds referred to in points (b) to (f) of the first subparagraph shall include the costs of fitting-out of the building. For rental and usufruct contracts, those thresholds shall take into account the costs of the fitting-out of the building but not the other charges. Without prejudice to Article 17, a building acquisition project may be financed through a loan, subject to prior approval by the European Parliament and by the Council. Loans shall be contracted and repaid in accordance with the principle of sound financial management and with due regard to the financial interests of the Union. When the Union institution proposes to finance the acquisition through a loan, the financing plan to be submitted, together with the request for prior approval by the Union institution concerned, shall specify in particular, the maximum level of financing, the financing period, the type of financing, the financing conditions and savings compared to other types of contractual arrangements. L 193/154  The European Parliament and the Council shall deliberate upon the request for prior approval within four weeks, extendable once by two weeks, of its receipt by both institutions. The acquisition financed through a loan shall be deemed to be rejected if the European Parliament and the Council do not expressly approve it within the deadline."
